# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, **please do not report it in a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, use one of the following private channels:

- Open a **GitHub Security Advisory** for this repository (preferred)
- Or contact the maintainers directly if a private email channel is listed

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any relevant proof-of-concept or logs

We will acknowledge receipt and work to assess the issue as quickly as possible.

## Bug Bounties

At this time, this project does **not** operate a formal bug bounty program.  
However, valid and responsibly disclosed security issues may be acknowledged in release notes or documentation at the maintainers’ discretion.

Thank you for helping keep the project and its users safe.
